This project is my final project data management project course.
The project involve uisng bash to preprocess the lyrics data from txt. file to json files. Then feed in preprocessed 
lyrics and json files with information about songs and artist  retrieved from the Genius API
into the neo4j graphical database in order to get some interesting manipulations and representation.
