Song:   Am I Wrong
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Well I
Well I

[Verse 1]
I'm only comin' out to play
Nothin' more that I hate in this life
The wrong impression, I only have one to make
You can open your palm
Waiting to catch a break
The cards will fall where they may
And what about me?
I believe in fate
They wanna know where I'll be in five
What about today?
What about tonight?

[Chorus 1]
Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life

[Bridge]
Am I wrong to assume
If she can dance, then she can't ooh?
Am I wrong to say
If she can dance, then she can't ooh?

[Chorus 2]
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life

[Verse 2]
Smiles around tHe clock
Dance around tHe globe to Disco 54
I stare at you in tHe eyes and spin you on your toes
Music ain't music witHout soul
Feelin' tHe top row
SHut tHe blindfolds, pass tHe nitro
Rock tHe love boat, get HigH or get low
CHill tHe Merlot, steady your fast pour
Make love
Do tHat-tHat-tHat
Break you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat
Never seen a one tHis gorgeous
Pay your wHole damn mortgage
Will you look at tHe time?
Still you tHe one on my mind
Still you tHe top of tHe line
THank God tHat it's Friday
TonigHt let's be tHe life of tHe party
It's up to me
Get up and move your feet

[Chorus 3]
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine

I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine
