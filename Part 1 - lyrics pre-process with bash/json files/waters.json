"[Intro] Yes lord, yeah  [Verse 1] Tried to tell niggas, in 2012, nigga Working hand to hand and no avail Volume one was too heavy for you frail niggas So I got leaned like codeine and pills It's the visionary, in the vintage Chevy It's been a while but wow you still care Free Nash 'til the pass out obituaries In bold caps, your bitch-ass was not there And I can do anything but move backwards The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted My big sister still claim me on them taxes Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this Gave my momma ten racks And she packed and went to Chumash with it Could triple the worth and give me half of it Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxs' The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM Whack niggas dropping links in my DM Bad bitches up and down a nigga TL I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof If you want you could wait outside the building I ain't takin' no more meetings  [Chorus 1] Stepped in the waters The water was cold Chi in my body But not in my soul  [Verse 2] I bring you greetings from the first church of Boom Baptists United Fellowship of Free Nationals Residing pastor is thy.Paak And the first lady is a bad bitch With slanted eyelids and thick asses Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas Sweating on my Patent Leathers Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers We'll do one better Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing Only a handful will go the distance I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout, what they could do I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo I was in the jungle running with Zulu's We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast You had to be shopping at Ginsu To the top of the food group Doing what I want and how I should too  [Chorus 2] Stepped in the waters The water was cold Chi in my body But it didn't touch my soul Stepped in the waters The water was cold Chi in my body But it didn't touch my soul  [Outro] Ladies in gentlemen, the most fantastic day in history Would you boys mind explaining the cause Of what made this great park go underneath this hood Take a look at this "
